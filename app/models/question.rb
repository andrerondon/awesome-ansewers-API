class Question < ApplicationRecord
    # This is the Question model. We generated this
    # file with the command:
    # rails g model question title:string body:text
    # This command also generates a migration file in 
    # db/migrate

    # Rails will add att_accessors for all columns
    # of the table (i.e title, body, created_at, updated_at, ...)
end
