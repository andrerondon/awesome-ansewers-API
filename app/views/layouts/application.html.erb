      above ðŸ‘† we are including the JavaScript code in the app.
      javascript_pack_tag is a helper method that's provided by
      webpacker. This is equivalent to javascript_link_tag from
      assett pipeline.
      The javascript_pack_tag takes care of making sure that
      it references compiled assets properly in devlopment mode
      as well as in production mode similar to the assets pipeline.
